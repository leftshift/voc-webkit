voc-webkit
==========
A project which aims to provide easy-to-use, effective,
cross-platform vocabulary trainer.

The project is still very much in its beginnings, but the plan is to use
node-webkit as the framework and probably save all the vocabulary data
to JSON-files.

At some point, versions for IOS and Android would be epic. Porting should
be possible... ?

Another planned feature (?) is to give the user the ability to flag words
(as important, false friend, whatever) and also categorize the kind of
word.

The coolest thing wold be to use online sources to figure out as what
the two words in the two languages can be used and find the one in common.
If we're not sure, maybe ask the user or just pick none.

If you know a thing or two about web design, javascript or node-webkit,
(or, like me, have *no idea what you are doing*) feel free to help!
